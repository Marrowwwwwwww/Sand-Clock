# Why this app exists?
Well, I found that timekeeping apps make me eventually want to ignore their notifications, which ends up making me procrastinate taking a break, defeating the whole purpose!




Then I thought to myself "I wish I had an hourglass on my desk"

I would occasionally glance over at it, and when I randomly noticed that all the sand had settled at the bottom, I would naturally want to take a break anyway, since my attention wouldn't have been grabbed by a nagging notification while I was in the middle of doing something interesting (That's when I tend to procrastinate taking breaks the most)

So I made a virtual hourglass!

By default they are like this:
